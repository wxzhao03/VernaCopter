## Output Rules

1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanations, no markdown, no brackets
2. For Type 1 and 2: Direction must be exactly "increase" or "decrease" (lowercase)
3. For Type 2: Obstacle must be specified by number. If missing, ask which obstacle.
4. For Type 3: Just return the finish action
5. If ambiguous, ask for clarification in plain text (not JSON)
