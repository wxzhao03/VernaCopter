trajectory_analysis.py

This module provides the `TrajectoryAnalyzer` class, which handles tasks related to analyzing trajectories of drones in defined scenarios. 
It supports:
- Checking task specifications using GPT-based evaluation.
- Visualizing trajectories relative to predefined objects.
- Validating task completion based on scenario-specific rules.

Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- GPT (custom class for interacting with ChatGPT)
- NL_to_STL (custom class for NL-to-STL conversion)

class TrajectoryAnalyzer:
    """
    A class to analyze drone trajectories with respect to predefined objects and scenarios.

    Attributes:
    - objects (dict): Dictionary defining the boundaries of objects in the environment.
    - x (ndarray): Array of drone positions at each time step.
    - N (int): Number of time steps.
    - dt (float): Time interval between steps.

    Methods:
    - GPT_spec_check: Uses GPT to validate task specifications based on the drone's trajectory.
    - visualize_spec: Visualizes the drone's trajectory relative to predefined objects.
    - task_accomplished_check: Validates if the task was completed successfully based on scenario-specific conditions.
    - get_inside_objects_text: Generates a text summary of the drone's interactions with objects.
    - get_inside_objects_array: Creates a binary array indicating whether the drone is inside each object at each time step.
    - is_inside: Checks if a point is within a defined object's boundaries.
